Matrimony Fraud Detector is a **browser-based AI-LIKE tool** that analyzes uploaded profiles to identify **suspicious activity patterns**. Using a **multi-feature ensemble**, it evaluates profiles for potential fraud while keeping all data **local to your device**.


---


## ❓ Typical profile screening vs. our system


### 🔹 Traditional approaches


* Manual vetting and verification

* Limited cross-profile comparison

* Often misses subtle duplications or reused data

* Privacy risk when data leaves the device


### 🔹 Matrimony Fraud Detector


**Living profiles, intelligently analyzed. Not just scanned, but understood.**


* Computes **bio similarity, photo reuse, credential overlap, timing variance, visit frequency, Aadhaar verification weight, and phonetic name similarity**

* Detects patterns like reused phone/email, repeated photos, or similar bios across multiple profiles

* Multi-layered scoring: **Linear model + Naive Bayes ensemble**

* Fully **in-browser execution**: no data leaves your device

* Adjustable ensemble weights & thresholds for **custom detection sensitivity**

* Real-time visualization of suspicious scores with intuitive color coding:


  * **Low risk:** green

  * **Medium:** yellow

  * **High:** red

* Detailed feature breakdown per profile for audit & transparency

* Export results as JSON for reporting or research

## 🔍 Feature Breakdown


* **Bio Analysis** – Detect overlapping phrases or word patterns across profiles

* **Photo Reuse Detection** – Matches photo content or filenames across profiles

* **Credential Overlap** – Detects reused phone numbers and emails

* **Activity Timing Analysis** – Checks visit patterns and timing variance

* **Name Phonetic Similarity** – Boosts similarity score for similar-sounding names

* **Aadhaar Verification Weight** – Trusted identity markers influence scores

* **Linear + Naive Bayes Ensemble** – Combines deterministic and probabilistic scoring

* **Noise Layer** – Adds slight randomness to prevent overfitting in small datasets

* **Privacy-First Design** – All processing stays **on your device**

* **Exportable Results** – Save suspicious scores for offline analysis

## 👥 Who Is It For?


* Matrimony platform moderators

* Fraud detection & risk teams

* Researchers analyzing online identity reuse

* Developers building safer matchmaking systems


---


## ⚙️ Setup & Usage


Simply open the HTML in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox recommended):


1. **Upload or paste JSON profiles**

2. **Optionally train the linear + Naive Bayes ensemble**

3. **Adjust thresholds and ensemble weights**

4. **Run detection**

5. **View results or export as JSON**


All calculations are **performed locally**, ensuring maximum privacy. Compliance matched*
*subject to terms and conditions and not guaranteed
